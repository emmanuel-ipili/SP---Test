# SP---Test
This repository contains the sample Friend Management Project


I am sorry but I am not able to finish the test. 
The effort taken so far for the code committed is 6 hours and 20 mins. 

The items that are not tackled are user story 4, 5 and 6. I am also missing the one command to deploy my service so that it can be tested. I initially planned to write a shell script for this purpose.

I am also missing the usual unit tests that should be written for the repository, services and the controllers and their respective multiple cases and edge cases.

The only reason that I can offer as to why I am not able to finish is due to two reason,
1. It has been quite awhile since I have last worked with Rest type microservices. I know that this is really not even REST but RPC. Of course, I realise that the test requirement didn't even asked for REST style which include HATEOAS.
2. I have decided to use Spring Boot which I have not used previously to write the service. For this decision, I am expecting that it will lighten the load in writing the services as compared to not using this framework and using jersey instead. I am correct in this respect and as a bonus, I have learned a bit on how to make use of Spring Boot.

I know that I am lacking a lot of things in this test submission but I still like to thank you for the ooportunity and your time.
